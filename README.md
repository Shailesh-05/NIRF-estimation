# NIRF-estimation
I have worked on building a predictive model used to find and improve NIRF rankings of various Indian Colleges and Universities specifically in the area of Engineering based on NISE (NIRF score estimator).
->Performed extensive data pre-processing and statistical analysis.
->Used standard ML Algorithms such as :Linear regression,Polynomial regression and Logarithmic regression to build the predictive framework for models.
->Also formulated own Regression based equations for some of the ranking metrics to get best solution.
